## Project Overview: 

Max You and Pengru Lin are two students from Babson College. For our project, we envision to build a platform that allow users to be able to check and compare prices and room types of airbnb different regions in the United States. We would like to create website using US airbnb information APIs. We expect the final product to ease the users' pain of finding airbnb prices and room types by allowing them to enter and select location in the States to come out with airbnb prices and room types nearby accordingly.

To run and execute our code, simply go to our Github Page (https://github.com/pengrulin/pengrulin.github.io), and execute the app.py code.
